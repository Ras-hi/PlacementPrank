3- GCD: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/gcd-of-two-numbers3459/1
      euclidean  method :
      Implementation
->If B is 0, it means A is the greatest common divisor. So, return A.
->If B is not 0, call the gcd function recursively with B as the new A and A % B as the new B.
->This step effectively replaces A with B and B with the remainder when dividing A by B.
->The recursive calls continue until B becomes 0, at which point the function returns A, which is the greatest common divisor.
